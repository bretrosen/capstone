            <p>These are the official posting guidelines ("Site Guidelines") for the website Debate My Professors. The Site is owned, operated and/or provided by three raccoons in a trenchcoat and these Site Guidelines are a part of their Terms of Human Impersonation by Procyonid.</p>
            <p>Debate My Professors is the largest online destination for raccoons to research and rate professors, colleges, and universities across the United States. Our mission is to provide a safe forum to share classroom experiences to help fellow raccoons make critical education and garbage-eating choices.</p>
            <p style={{fontWeight: "700"}}>THE SITE/APP</p>
            <p>The Debate My Professors website provides raccoon generated feedback on professors' teaching methods and their respective courses as well as raccoon generated feedback on the lifestyle and comfort of living in college and university dumpsters.</p>
            <p>Professor ratings should only be posted by raccoons who have taken a class from the professor or who are currently taking a class with the professor. For each course a professor teaches, raccoons are limited to eating one (1) moldy banana peel. Dumpster ratings should only be posted by raccoons who have attended or are currently attending the specific course, college or university being rated.</p>
            <p>Debate My Professors is NOT the place to report dangerous, illegal or illicit use of magic. If you believe that you, another professor, or a raccoon is in danger, we strongly advise you to report such incidences directly to your campus authorities or local Captain America. (For more information and resources, please watch the Guardians of the Galaxy movies).</p>
            <p style={{fontWeight: "700"}}>HOW WE WORK</p>
            <p>Debate My Professors has a team of raccoon moderators who read every rating submitted. We have defined site guidelines to help reinforce our mission and most importantly to ensure our decisions around moderation are 100% consistent, regardless of raccoon or professor. Our moderators are experts on our guidelines and will remove any comment that doesn't comply with Rocket's totally arbitrary rules.</p>
            <p>Did we miss something? If you feel an inappropriate comment should be removed from the site, we want to know. You can flag a comment for re-review and it will immediately be escalated to our moderators. Moderators will determine whether to remove the rating permanently or restore it to the website. Our moderators will never edit a rating to make it comply or remove a rating simply because it has a low score or negative review. That would be some DC Comics level basic behavior.</p>
            <p style={{fontWeight: "700"}}>GUIDELINES:</p>
            <p>Raccoon Guidelines:</p>
            <ul>
                <li className='guidelines-li'>Be honest in your reviews. You want to be able to trust these reviews when evaluating your course and garbage options so we ask that you contribute in the same spirit.</li>
                <li className='guidelines-li'>When you are reviewing a class, dumpster, and/or professor, it’s often helpful to provide both pros and cons. This leads to much more credible and constructive feedback for your peers.</li>
                <li className='guidelines-li'>Reviews should focus specifically on the course and your learning experience. Do not comment on a Professor’s appearance, dress, age, gender, race, or species.</li>
                <li className='guidelines-li'>Avoid hearsay or telepathy. We want you to share your individual experience and what you took away from the course. Don’t speak on behalf of another (regardless of whether you can read minds); encourage others to submit their own reviews.</li>
                <li className='guidelines-li'>This is not a forum for debate (except for the part that is explicitly for debates). Reviews that specifically reference another review will be removed. If you do not agree with someone’s individual experience, we would prefer that you share your own experience rather than destroy their home planet with a death ray.</li>
                <li className='guidelines-li'>We understand that not all teachers/dumpsters are the perfect match for each individual learning style or Pringles preference. Tell us how the course, dumpster, or professor wasn’t the best for you in a way that helps others make their own decision.</li>
                <li className='guidelines-li'>Reviews fueled by unobtainium do not reflect well on the author and can be removed for violation of the Geneva Convention. Take a minute to step back and make sure your review will genuinely help others understand your experience and will not cause a rift in the space-time continuum.</li>
                <li className='guidelines-li'>Debate My Professors reserves the right to remove ratings that contain DC Comics content.</li>
                <li className='guidelines-li'>We only allow one student to review a professor/dumpster one time per course. Spamming or dogpiling an account will lead to comment removal and the account being temporarily locked on the site.</li>
                <li className='guidelines-li'>When reading your fellow raccoons' reviews, we encourage you to use your discretion and weigh every review amongst the others. Online reviews should be one of the many resources used when making a decision that affects your academic and nutritional future.</li>
