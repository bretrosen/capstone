But we beat on, brains against the tide, brought back onto the shores of knowledge, and we learned a few things about ourselves, and carbon dating, even though that was totally unrelated to the course content.",

        "It was the best of classes, it was the worst of classes, it was a class of wisdom, it was a class of foolishness, it was full of belief, it was full of incredulity, it was the fall semester of hope, it was the spring semester of despair, we had no exams, we had a 72 hour final exam. A very confusing and contradictory course.",
        "The professor, at forty, knew their life had been ruined by academia, but they kept on teaching anyway. This class could have been so much more if the professor cared. At all. It wasâ€¦ fine."
        "It was a pleasure to burn the course syllabus after barely passing the final. This class is TOUGH! ",
        "It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single professor in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a spouse. THIS PROF IS SO HAWT!!!",
        "There was no possibility of taking any other course than this one. It was truly enthralling and endlessly educational.",
        "Weird and unsettling but super interesting. This professor probably shouldn't teach this course, but it is a WILD RIDE if you just strap your brain seatbelt on."
